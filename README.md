- 👋 Hi, I’m Eren
- 👀 I’m (very generally) interested in bandit problems in matching markets.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to improve recommender system operations using contextual bandits.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and everything that is exciting in the bandit literature that is not *only* a topic of theoretical interest.
