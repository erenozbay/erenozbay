- Hi, Iâ€™m Eren
- Iâ€™m (very generally) interested in bandit problems, more focused on matching markets.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to improve recommender system operations using contextual bandits, e.g., how loose of an assumption can be made on the structure of a model to beat existing benchmarks in operationalization as well as performance.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any and everything that is exciting in the bandit literature that is not *solely* a topic of theoretical interest.
