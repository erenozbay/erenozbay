- 👋 Hi, I’m Eren
- 👀 I’m (very generally) interested in bandit problems, more focused on matching markets.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to improve recommender system operations using contextual bandits, e.g., how loose of an assumption can be made on the structure of a model to beat existing benchmarks in operationalization as well as performance.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and everything that is exciting in the bandit literature that is not *solely* a topic of theoretical interest.
